### Questions:

1. What is GIL? Why it is implemented in python? 
2. What is the difference between thread and process? 
3. How garbage collection works? 

### Materials: 

1. (ipython) (GIL and GC)[https://github.com/Tobichimaru/Python/blob/master/GIL%2C%20GC.ipynb]
2. Garbage collection:

### Tasks

1. Suppose you have two methods that generate odd and even numbers. Your task is to output
a range of numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially using these two methods.
2. Solve the task about (dining philosophers problem)[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Задача_об_обедающих_философах]. 
The essence of the problem is to develop a model of behavior (parallel algorithm), in which none of the philosophers will starve, that is, will always alternate food intake and reflection (the philosopher must begin with thinking).
Take a look into the interface given in this week module. Feel free to implement a new class that implement a `Fork` or `Philosopher` class.
